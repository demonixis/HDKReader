# HDK Reader
This is a research project which aims to create a very lightweight runtime for the OSVR HDK familly. 
The code is inspired by [OpenHMD](https://github.com/OpenHMD/OpenHMD).
Everything is made using the C# langage.

## What is it?
- A library that do the connection and fetch data
- A WebSocket Server (with a very wip debugger)
- An Unity project that connects to the server and rotate a cube using the HDK's rotation

## Known issues
The rotation is bad for now.
